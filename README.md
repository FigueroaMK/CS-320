# CS-320
Software Test and Automation Journal

During the time in this course I have learned about software testing and how testing automation has been developing as well as it advantages and the implications of such development. Three questions remain outsatanding:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  The answer to this question would seem obvious by testing the code often and thourghly. However I think there is a little bit more than that to ensure your project is functional and secure. You would need to take a sistematic approach to developing your project, developing requirements and testing strategies before coding happens. That being said the testing phase should include success paths and failure paths.

  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    If any step of the development process give me mind bending anxiety this one is it. Since interpretation is often very subjective, I believe this is one step where I would feel the need to check in with the client often. Recording the requirements established and asking why, how or how the user envisions this requirement to be are some of the steps I would follow to ensure that their needs are met.

  How do I approach designing software?
    As I go through the CS program my approach to designing software has been constantly changing. At the very start my approach was no more than creating code that would fullfil a task, by now I have a more standardized step like approach to developing code. My biggest take away from the CS-320 course is regression testing.
